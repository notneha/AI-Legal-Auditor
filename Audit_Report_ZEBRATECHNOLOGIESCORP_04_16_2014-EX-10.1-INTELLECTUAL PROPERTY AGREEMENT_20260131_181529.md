### EXECUTIVE AUDIT SUMMARY

| Clause Category | Risk Level | Identified Risk | Business Impact | Suggested Redline |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. IP Ownership Assignment** | 🟡 | The license granted to the Purchaser is "non-sublicenseable" and "non-transferable" (Section 2.1(b)). | Prevents the Purchaser from utilizing third-party contractors or transferring the IP rights during a corporate restructuring or sale of the business unit. | Strike "non-sublicenseable" and "non-transferable." Replace with: "sublicenseable to Affiliates and contractors, and transferable in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all assets." |
| **2. Price Restrictions** | 🟢 | No price-fixing, MFN (Most Favored Nation), or minimum pricing requirements are present in the provided text. | High operational flexibility; the business retains full control over its pricing strategy. | No change required. |
| **3. Non-compete & Exclusivity** | 🟢 | The licenses granted are "non-exclusive" (Section 2.1(b)). No restrictive covenants (non-competes) were identified in the text. | The Seller can license the same IP to competitors, but the Purchaser is not legally barred from competing in any specific market. | If the Business is the primary driver of value, negotiate "Exclusive" rights for the specific "Smart Sensing Network" field of use. |
| **4. Termination for Convenience** | 🟢 | Licenses are explicitly "irrevocable" and "perpetual" (Section 2.1(b)). | Provides long-term security for the Business; the Seller cannot arbitrarily revoke the right to use the IP. | Ensure the "except as expressly set forth herein" language does not link to a broad "Termination for Cause" clause that includes minor administrative breaches. |
| **5. Governing Law** | 🟡 | The provided text is silent on Governing Law and Venue. | In the event of a dispute, the parties may face "forum shopping" or be forced to litigate in an unfavorable or expensive jurisdiction. | Insert: "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles. Exclusive jurisdiction shall be in the courts of [Preferred County/State]." |
